Unable to deploy after hours and countless tries, i feel like there is no error in my code or setting up my ECR and EKS, kindly check the describe pod ERROR image.

I tried playing with roles and policies and i was always logged in using the command "aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 914303283224.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

I require some guidance since i have exhausted all online articles and documentations i can find.
